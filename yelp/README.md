# System Design for Proximity Service (Yelp-like Application)

## Initial Conversation: Scope Clarification
The design process begins with an exploratory conversation to establish the **scope** and **key functionalities** of the service. The exchange between the candidate and the interviewer focuses on defining the search radius, the user's ability to modify this radius, and the system's real-time data update capabilities.

### Key Dialogue Points
- **Search Radius**: Can users set the search radius, and if so, how does the system adapt if no businesses are found within the given radius?
- **Maximum Radius**: What's the maximum search radius allowed by the system?
- **User Interface Interaction**: How does the user interface allow changes to the search radius?
- **Real-time Data**: How are business information additions, deletions, and updates handled by the system?

## Functional Requirements
These requirements define what the system should do, outlining the core functionalities that enable users to interact with the service effectively.

1. **Proximity Searches**: Users should be able to search for businesses based on their geographic location.
2. **Dynamic Data**: The system should support the addition, deletion, and updating of business information without needing real-time updates for the user end.
3. **Business Information Access**: Detailed information about businesses must be accessible to users.

## Non-Functional Specifications
These specifications underpin the architecture's quality attributes, not directly tied to functionality but crucial for system effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

- **Scalability and High Availability**: Foremost, the architecture must sustain a robust performance under varying load, maintaining high service availability during demand surges, characteristic of urban centers and special events.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Response times must be minimal, as the utility of the service is highly dependent on its ability to present local business information promptly.
- **Security and Privacy Compliance**: Protecting user data is paramount. The system must enforce stringent measures to safeguard location data, adhering to international standards such as GDPR and local legislations like CCPA.
- **Reliability**: The service is expected to operate consistently, with a resilient design that mitigates and recovers swiftly from failures.

Incorporating these foundational specifications, we create a robust groundwork for diving into the architecture's detailed system design and API construction.

## GraphQL API Design 

Using [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/learn/), we construct a more efficient, flexible API by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues common in [**RESTful**](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) services.

## Schema Definition

We could potentially autogenerate this GraphQL schema by using code generation. I mean, this is the only way. Why would we want to have to manually keep track of and update this schema üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. This approach ensures our schema definition stays in sync with the underlying data models and resolvers without manual updates. Various tools and libraries can introspect our data models and business logic to create or update the schema accordingly.

### Types

```graphql
type Business {
  business_id: ID!
  address: String!
  city: String!
  state: String!
  country: String!
  location: Location!
}

type Location {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}

type Query {
  # Query to get detailed information about a business
  business(business_id: ID!): Business

  # Query to get a list of businesses based on location and optional filters
  searchNearby(latitude: Float!, longitude: Float!, radius: Int, filters: SearchFilters): [Business]
}

type Mutation {
  # Mutation to create a new business
  createBusiness(input: BusinessInput!): Business

  # Mutation to update an existing business
  updateBusiness(business_id: ID!, input: BusinessInput!): Business

  # Mutation to delete a business
  deleteBusiness(business_id: ID!): Boolean
}

# Input types define the structure for the mutations
input BusinessInput {
  address: String!
  city: String!
  state: String!
  country: String!
  location: LocationInput!
}

input LocationInput {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}

# Filters for the search query can include various parameters
input SearchFilters {
  category: String
  rating: Float
  # Any additional filters can be included as needed
}
```

Here is an example of searching for nearby businesses. I want to explain that I did not include Pagination in the GraphQL Schema, however this is how page-based Pagination would look like. We use pagination, so we don't need to query for more information than we need at the given moment. This is because a user might not want to scroll through 1000 businesses just to search for a place to eat, a top 20 would suffice, and if they don't see any options they like, they can click a button `See more results` and it will load the next page of businesses. 

```graphql
query SearchNearbyBusinesses {
  searchNearby(
    latitude: 37.7749,
    longitude: -122.4194,
    radius: 5000,
    page: 1,
    pageSize: 20
  ) {
    businesses {
      business_id
      address
      city
      state
      country
      location {
        latitude
        longitude
      }
    }
    cursor
  }
}
```
